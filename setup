# Git Setup Guide

## First Time Git Setup (Do This Once)

Before using Git, you need to tell it who you are. This is like signing your name on your work.

### Step 1: Set Your Name
```bash
git config --global user.name "Maithiligithub19"
```
**What it does:** Tells Git your name. This name will show up when you save changes.

### Step 2: Set Your Email
```bash
git config --global user.email "maithili.sude21@pccoepune.org"
```
**What it does:** Tells Git your email. GitHub uses this to connect your work to your account.

### Step 3: Check Your Settings
```bash
git config --list
```
**What it does:** Shows all your Git settings to make sure everything is correct.

## Why This Matters
- Your name and email appear on every save (commit)
- GitHub knows it's really you making changes
- Other people can see who made what changes
- You only need to do this setup once on each computer
