# Git Folders - Simple Guide

## 3 Types of Folders

### Working Directory
- Your normal folder where you edit files
- You can see and touch your files here

### Local Repository  
- Hidden `.git` folder on your computer
- Saves history of your changes
- Works without internet

### Remote Repository
- Your project on GitHub (online)
- Others can see it
- Backup of your work

## How They Work
1. Edit files in Working Directory
2. Save to Local Repository (`git commit`)
3. Upload to Remote Repository (`git push`)

Think: Kitchen table → Recipe box → Online cookbook
